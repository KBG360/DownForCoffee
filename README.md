# DownForCoffee

Down for coffee?

Matches you with a random person near your location

You can see a small description / picture of the person you're talking with

5-10 minute conversation

Upon end of time the user is asked if they want to talk some more with the person (Down for coffee?)

If both users respond with a yes, the nearest coffee shops / hangout places are put in a list and both users can choose (Maybe make it a random place close to both persons?)

Upon agreening to a place to hang out, both users propose a time to go

Both users confirm that they are going to the specified place at the specified time and make a small "promise" with the other person that they are not gonna leave them hanging and stay at home

Upon agreement to go some personal information can be shared automatically, like for example phone number or email (Some way to contact outside of the app)

To solve timing issues the users can opt in to get a notification when someone has been searching for a person to talk to for a while

Not a dating app, designed to make friends and to prioritize face to face connections.
